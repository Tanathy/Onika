# Dataset

This is a convenient place to keep the **dataset for the current training run**.

You’ll typically see things like:
- `*.png` / `*.jpg` images
- `*.txt` comma separated caption files

If you’re unsure where to start: add a few images + matching caption files, run a small test training, then scale up.
