# Models

This folder is where you keep your **Stable Diffusion model files** (for example: `.safetensors`).

If you’re setting up Onika for the first time, drop your checkpoints here and then pick them from the UI.

Typical files you might have here:
- Base checkpoints (SD 1.5 / SDXL / etc.)
- Fine-tuned checkpoints
- Any other local model files Onika can load
